Contributions are what makes the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated.

## House rules

Before submitting a new issue or PR, check if it already exists in [issues](link-to-issues) or [PRs](link-to-prs).

GitHub issues: take note of the ðŸš¨ needs approval label ![Needs Approval](https://img.shields.io/badge/needs%20approval-yes-red).

#### Feature Requests:

Wait for a core member to approve and remove the ðŸš¨ needs approval label ![Needs Approval](https://img.shields.io/badge/needs%20approval-yes-red) before you start coding or submit a PR.

#### Bugs, Security, Performance, Documentation, etc.:

You can start coding immediately, even if the ðŸš¨ needs approval label ![Needs Approval](https://img.shields.io/badge/needs%20approval-yes-red) is present. This label mainly concerns feature requests.

## Our Process:

- Issues from non-core members automatically receive the ðŸš¨ needs approval label ![Needs Approval](https://img.shields.io/badge/needs%20approval-yes-red).
- We greatly value new feature ideas. To ensure consistency in the product's direction, they undergo review and approval.
